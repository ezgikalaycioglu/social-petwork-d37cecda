# Security Fixes Applied

## FCM Tokens Security Vulnerability - FIXED âœ…

### Issue Description
The `fcm_tokens` table was previously accessible with an overly broad "ALL" RLS policy that could potentially expose Firebase Cloud Messaging tokens to unauthorized users. These tokens could be stolen and used to send unauthorized push notifications.

### Security Risk Level: CRITICAL
- **Attack Vector**: Token theft for unauthorized push notifications
- **Impact**: Users could receive spam or malicious notifications
- **Data Exposed**: FCM tokens, device information, user associations

### Fix Implemented
1. **Granular RLS Policies**: Replaced single "ALL" policy with specific policies for each operation:
   - `Users can view their own FCM tokens` (SELECT)
   - `Users can insert their own FCM tokens` (INSERT) 
   - `Users can update their own FCM tokens` (UPDATE)
   - `Users can delete their own FCM tokens` (DELETE)

2. **Access Restrictions**:
   - All policies restricted to `authenticated` users only
   - Each policy enforces `user_id = auth.uid()` constraint
   - Revoked all public access permissions

3. **Database Security**:
   - Ensured RLS is enabled on the table
   - Granted only necessary permissions to authenticated users
   - Blocked anonymous access completely

### Verification
- âœ… Four granular policies now protect each database operation
- âœ… Only authenticated users can access their own tokens
- âœ… Anonymous users have no access to FCM tokens
- âœ… No existing functionality broken (push notifications still work)

### Security Status
ðŸ”’ **FCM tokens are now fully protected and can only be accessed by their owners.**

## Database Security Definer Views - FIXED âœ…

### Issue Description
Security definer views (`business_profiles_public`, `pet_profiles_public`, `feed_items_view`) were bypassing RLS policies and exposing sensitive user data publicly.

### Fix Implemented
- Dropped all problematic public views
- Rebuilt social feed with secure, separate table queries
- Implemented location privacy for pet profiles
- Protected business contact information

## Remaining Security Recommendations

### 1. Enable Leaked Password Protection (WARN)
**Status**: User action required
**Action**: Enable in Supabase Auth settings

## Security Best Practices Now In Place

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all sensitive tables
2. **Granular Permissions**: Specific policies for each database operation
3. **User-Owned Data**: All personal data restricted to owners only
4. **Location Privacy**: Approximate coordinates for non-owners
5. **Contact Privacy**: Business emails/phones hidden from public
6. **No Security Definer**: Eliminated views that bypass RLS
